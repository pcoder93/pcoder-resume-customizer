\justifying{I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position at Potal Inc. With extensive experience in Full Stack Development and Data Science, I am eager to contribute to your team.

In my previous role at B Corp, I spearheaded the development of an AI-powered defect detection system for industrial machines. This project involved designing and deploying advanced image recognition algorithms that significantly enhanced production efficiency. My expertise in rapid prototyping enabled me to develop prototypes and minimum viable products, which accelerated project timelines and validated innovative solutions.

I have a strong background in managing development environments and field deployments. I led the deployment of test systems for SOTA AI based quality monitoring system, developed tools for dataset management, and integrated QMS with a Docker-based solution, enhancing workflow efficiency.

I possess strong proficiency in web technologies, including Python, TypeScript, and Docker, and I have hands-on experience with AWS and Kubernetes. My expertise aligns seamlessly with Potal Inc.'s technology stack, and I am committed to enhancing code quality and engineering practices.

I am enthusiastic about joining Potal Inc. to help revolutionize the industrial sector with AI technology. Thank you for considering my application.
